# NTU-to-Google-Calendar
Automatically generates NTU timetable in Google Calendar

This is an extremely simplified and draft version.



**Currently, it :**
- Saves all classes (e.g. Tutorial, Lecture) into one calendar
- Supports even and odd weeks classes (e.g. Week 4,6,8,.. and Week 3,5,7,..)
- Removes classes in recess week
- Allows modification to start term date and end term date
  - These dates are currently set for [AY2015-2016](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Students/Undergraduate/AcademicServices/AcademicCalendar/Pages/AY2015-16.aspx)
